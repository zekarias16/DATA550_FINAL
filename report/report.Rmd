## Viral Load Trends by Population Size

This section explores how SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations vary based on the population served by each wastewater treatment plant.

```{r load-population-trend-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output", "viral_load_trend_by_population.png"))
```

The plot above displays average viral load percentiles across time for small, medium, and large population groups. Using percentiles helps standardize comparisons between wastewater sites. Larger populations tend to show more stable trends, while small communities show more fluctuation, possibly due to limited sample size or system variability.

## Comparison of Viral Load by Population Group

This boxplot shows how viral load percentiles appear similar across small, medium, and large population groups. While median viral load levels are quite similar across the three, small communities have a wider spread of values â€” potentially due to fluctuations in local transmission or limited population buffering effects in smaller systems.
